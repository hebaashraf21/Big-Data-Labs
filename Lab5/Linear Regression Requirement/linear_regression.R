#(Q7) Import the dataset LungCapData.tsv. What are the variables in this dataset?
setwd("E:/CMP4/LAAAASSSTT TTTEEEERRRMM/Big Data/Big-Data-Labs/Lab5/Linear Regression Requirement")

# Import the dataset
lung_data <- read.table("LungCapData.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# View the variables in the dataset
names(lung_data)


#(Q8) Draw a scatter plot of Age (x-axis) vs. LungCap (y-axis). Label x-axis "Age" and y-axis "LungCap"

plot(lung_data$Age, lung_data$LungCap, xlab = "Age", ylab = "LungCap", main = "Age vs. LungCap Scatter Plot")


#(Q9) Draw a pair-wise scatter plot between Lung Capacity, Age and Height. 
#Check the slides for how to plot a pair-wise scatterplot

# Create a pair-wise scatter plot
pairs(lung_data[, c("LungCap", "Age", "Height")], main = "Pair-wise Scatter Plot")


#(Q10) Calculate correlation between Age and LungCap, and between Height and LungCap.
#Hint: You can use the function cor

# Calculate the correlation between Age and LungCap

#(Q11) Which of the two input variables (Age, Height) are more correlated to the 
#dependent variable (LungCap)?

#(Q12) Do you think the two variables (Height and LungCap) are correlated ? why ?

#(Q13) Fit a liner regression model where the dependent variable is LungCap 
#and use all other variables as the independent variables

model <- lm(LungCap ~ Age + Height + Smoke + Gender + Caesarean, data = lung_data)




#(Q14) Show a summary of this model
summary(model)

#(Q15) What is the R-squared value here ? What does R-squared indicate?

#(Q16) Show the coefficients of the linear model. Do they make sense?
#If not, which variables don't make sense? What should you do?

#(Q17) Redraw a scatter plot between Age and LungCap. Display/Overlay the linear model (a line) over it.
#Hint: Use the function abline(model, col="red").
#Note (1) : A warning will be displayed that this function will display only the first two 
#           coefficients in the model. It's OK.
#Note (2) : If you are working correctly, the line will not be displayed on the plot. Why?
# Scatter plot of Age vs. LungCap

# Fit a linear regression model with Age, Smoke, and Cesarean as independent variables
model2 <- lm(LungCap ~ Age + Smoke + Caesarean, data = lung_data)

# Show a summary of the new model

#(Q19)Repeat Q16, Q17 for the new model. What happened?
# Scatter plot of Age vs. LungCap

# Overlay the linear model

#(Q20)Predict results for this regression line on the training data.
# Predict LungCap values using the new model
predicted_values <- predict(model2, lung_data)

# Show the first few predicted values
head(predicted_values)

#(Q21)Calculate the mean squared error (MSE)of the training data.

# Calculate the residuals (actual - predicted) from the model
